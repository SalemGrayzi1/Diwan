### Building the HydraApp
app = hy.HydraApp(title='Diwan')

### A progress bar that shows how long is left to get results
my_bar = st.progress(0)
for percent_complete in range(100):
    time.sleep(0.1)

### Importing csv file from github onto streamlit
df= pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalemGrayzi/status/main/Statuscsv.csv')

### Filling missing values in Adress column with the mode
df['Address'] =  df['Address'].fillna('ÿ®ÿ¥ÿßŸÖŸàŸÜ')

###Droping columns that dont add value to the analysis
df.drop(['Order No_','Phone No_','Receipt No','Company'], axis = 1, inplace = True)

### Dropping dublicates in the dataset
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

### Changing Boolean values into their respectable names
df['Handheld Used'] = df['Handheld Used'].map(
